            </h5>
            <p>Bhagat Singh (September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the murder of a junior British police officer and an Indian head constable in mistaken retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He also took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.</p>

            </h5>
            <p>Udham Singh (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940) was an Indian revolutionary belonging to Ghadar Party and HSRA, best known for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of the Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940. The assassination was done in revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar in 1919, for which O'Dwyer was responsible. Singh was subsequently tried and convicted of murder and hanged in July 1940. While in custody, he used the name Ram Mohammad Singh Azad, which represents the three major religions of India and his anti-colonial sentiment.

            <p>Vanchinatha Iyer (1886 – 17 June 1911), popularly known as Vanchinathan or Vanchi, was an Indian reactionary. He is best remembered for murdering Robert Ashe, the Tax Collector of Thirunelveli.Vanchinathan was born in 1886 in Sengottai to Raghupathy Iyer and Rukmani Ammal. His actual name was Shankaran.On 17 June 1911, Vanchi who was 25, assassinated Robert Ashe, the district collector of Tirunelveli, who was also known as Collector Dorai. He shot Ashe at point-blank range when Ashe's train had stopped at the Maniyachi Station, en route to Madras.[2] He committed suicide thereafter. The railway station has since been renamed Vanchi Maniyachi.</p>

This book reveals the 'real' and yet undiscovered Bhagat Singh. I was awestruck by the dazzling intellect of this youth who had such thoughts and notions as could transform the pitiable people to prosperous pearls of humanity. Ironically, we have limited our knowledge of Bhagat Singh to Yellow turban and pistol-brandishing. He was indeed the one who wanted emancipation of shackled masses.<br>

                                    It is a fascinating and gut-wrenching read and one of the things it reveals quite clearly is that in the first half of the 20th Century the British attitude to other nationalities, specifically in this case Indians, was to treat them as a lesser species of life. Inevitably some senior officials in the British Raj adopted a vicious, bullying approach to those they were sent to govern, in an administration that regarded itself as untouchable and free to behave however it liked. Whilst essentially an historical narrative, the story is written in the style of a “suspense thriller” and I could not put it down. Ultimately, this one hundred year old history threw up some unsettling parallels with our world today,as such, provides a hugely valuable lesson for us all <br>
